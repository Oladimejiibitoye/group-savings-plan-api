Demo Credit is a mobile lending app that requires wallet functionality. This is needed as borrowers need a wallet to receive the loans they have been granted and also send the money for repayments.

You are required to build an MVP (Minimum viable product) wallet service where:

- A user can create an account
- A user can fund their account
- A user can transfer funds to another userâ€™s account
- A user can withdraw funds from their account.
